## 2024-04-05 - Missing ARIA Labels on Close Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only modal close buttons in custom components (like those in `MobileToolbox.tsx`) often lack `aria-label` attributes and explicit `focus-visible` styling, hindering keyboard navigation and screen readers.
**Action:** Always verify icon-only buttons, especially in modals or toolboxes, have a descriptive `aria-label` and `focus-visible:ring-2` to support accessibility standards.
